<?php
$users = [
    "user1" => password_hash("password123", PASSWORD_DEFAULT),
    "user2" => password_hash("securepass456", PASSWORD_DEFAULT)
];

if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
    $username = $_POST["username"];
    $password = $_POST["password"];
    
    if (isset($users[$username]) && password_verify($password, $users[$username])) {
        echo "Login successful!";
    } else {
        echo "Login failed. Please check your credentials.";
    }
}

Remember that this example is still quite simplified for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, you should use proper password hashing algorithms, secure storage mechanisms, and implement additional security measures to prevent attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). It's also recommended to use HTTPS for secure data transmission.
